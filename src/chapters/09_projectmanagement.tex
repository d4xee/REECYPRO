\section{Evaluation\authorA{}}
When we started to conduct some research for the project in the summer break, we also began simultaneously to plan the work with agile project management methods.
As it turned out, doing the project management this way was really helpful.
During our work, we encountered a lot of obstacles which we had not thought of before, which resulted in a slower progress than we had previously expected.
Using an agile project board made it very easy for us to keep track of all of our work.
Even though on some days we had to add more tasks to the \emph{Todo} or \emph{In Progress} than to the \emph{Finished} section.
