\chapter{Experimental Section}

In the following chapter, we describe the work we carried out and why we did it.
We begin with methods for cultivating bacteria, which are followed by the extraction of proteins from \emph{M. extorquens}.
Afterwards, we describe how we analyzed the proteins.
In the end, we show you how we did the arsenazo-III assay.

\section{Protein Analysis\authorA}

\subsection{IR-Spectrometry}

The IR-Spectrometry was done using an ATR-IR-Spectrometer.
This meant that we could place the sample directly onto the device, without additional sample preparation.

The following table~\ref{tab:ir_exp_treatment} gives an overview of the lysed samples of \emph{M. extorquens} we measured, what treatments we gave the bacteria to grow in and when we measured the samples after the treatment.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l p{5cm} X}
        \hline
        \textbf{Type of sample}      & \textbf{Treatment}                           & \textbf{Weeks of growth after treatment} \\ \hline
        Proteins dissolved in water  & no treatment                                 & 0, 1 and 2                               \\

    \caption{Types of samples measured with IR-Spectrometry.}
    \label{tab:ir_exp_treatment}
\end{table}

We put a drop of a sample onto the ATR-IR-Spectrometer and measured the IR spectrum.
Before each measurement, we cleaned the ATR crystal with a drop of ethanol on a soft tissue.

\subsection{SDS-PAGE}

The SDS-PAGE was carried out as it is described in the guide of the manufacturer of our electrophoresis cell, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.~\cite{sdsbulletin}, with some slight modifications.

\textbf{Materials and Methods:}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ X l l }
        \hline
        \textbf{Ingredient} & \textbf{Volumina for Stacking Gel} & \textbf{Volumina for Resolving Gel} \\ \hline
        30\% Acrylamide     & 1,485mL                            & 4,5mL                               \\

        10\% SDS            & 150µL                              & 150µL                               \\
        di\ce{H2O}          & 9mL                                & 5,03mL                              \\

        10\% APS            & 90µL                               & 75µL                                \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Ingredients for SDS-PAGE gel.}
    \label{tab:ingredients_sdspage}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mix all ingredients except for TEMED and APS
    \item Add TEMED and APS to the resolving gel
    \item Transfer resolving gel into the gel cassette
    \item Add ethanol on top, to ensure that the stacking gel binds to the resolving gel
    \item Wait until the resolving gel has polymerized
    \item When the resolving gel is firm, pour off the ethanol
    \item Put the gel comb into the gel cassette, so that one end is between the glasses
    \item Add TEMED and APS to the stacking gel
    \item Fill the stacking gel into the gel cassette
    \item Make sure that no air bubble is between the tines of the comb
    \item Press the comb gently into the fluid gel
    \item Wait until the stacking gel has polymerized
\end{itemize}

We increased the amount of TEMED and APS by 20 percent compared to the manufacturer's guide, because oftentimes the resolving gel did not polymerize.

    \item 0,5M Tris-HCl pH6,8 3,75mL
    \item Glycerol 100\% 7,5mL
    \item 1,0\% Bromophenol blue 0,3mL
    \item 10\% SDS 6,0mL
    \item di\ce{H2O} to 30mL
    \item Mix all ingredients
    \item When the buffer is yellow, add Tris base until it is blue
\end{itemize}

Probe Preparation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mix the sample with the same amount of Laemmli-Buffer
    \item Heat the mixture to 95°C for 5min
\end{itemize}

We did not add \(\beta\)-mercaptoethanol to the sample/buffer mixture, because the chemical was not available at that time.

    \item Put the lid onto the box and plug in the electrodes
    \item Let the SDS-PAGE run for 60min at 100V
\end{itemize}
