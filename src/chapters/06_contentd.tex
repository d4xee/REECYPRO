\chapter{Experimental Section}

In the following chapter, we describe the work we carried out and why we did it.
We begin with methods for cultivating bacteria, which are followed by the extraction of proteins from \emph{M. extorquens}.
Afterwards, we describe how we analyzed the proteins.
In the end, we show you how we did the arsenazo-III assay.

    \item After centrifugation decant the liquid media out of the epi, be careful not to pour out the
    bacteria pellet that has formed on the bottom of the container
    \item Add an equal amount of water to your bacteria pellet and freeze it with a high-power freezer
    or liquid nitrogen
    \item Thaw the bacteria pellet fully in water no warmer than 37°
    \item Repeat this process 3 times
    \item Sonicate the Bacteria pellet while still in the epi for 5min in an ultrasonic bath

\section{Protein Analysis\authorA}

\subsection{IR-Spectrometry}

The IR-Spectrometry was done using an ATR-IR-Spectrometer.
This meant that we could place the sample directly onto the device, without additional sample preparation.

The following table~\ref{tab:ir_exp_treatment} gives an overview of the lysed samples of \emph{M. extorquens} we measured, what treatments we gave the bacteria to grow in and when we measured the samples after the treatment.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l p{5cm} X}
        \hline
        \textbf{Type of sample}      & \textbf{Treatment}                           & \textbf{Weeks of growth after treatment} \\ \hline
        Proteins dissolved in water  & no treatment                                 & 0, 1 and 2                               \\

        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Types of samples measured with IR-Spectrometry.}
    \label{tab:ir_exp_treatment}

        \textbf{Ingredient} & \textbf{Volumina for Stacking Gel} & \textbf{Volumina for Resolving Gel} \\ \hline
        30\% Acrylamide     & 1,485mL                            & 4,5mL                               \\

        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Ingredients for SDS-PAGE gel.}
    \label{tab:ingredients_sdspage}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mix all ingredients except for TEMED and APS
    \item Add TEMED and APS to the resolving gel
    \item Transfer resolving gel into the gel cassette
    \item Add ethanol on top, to ensure that the stacking gel binds to the resolving gel
    \item Wait until the resolving gel has polymerized

\end{itemize}

We increased the amount of TEMED and APS by 20 percent compared to the manufacturer's guide, because oftentimes the resolving gel did not polymerize.

\end{itemize}

Probe Preparation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mix the sample with the same amount of Laemmli-Buffer
    \item Heat the mixture to 95°C for 5min
\end{itemize}
