\chapter{System Overview}

In order to understand the process of the recovery of rare earth elements from electronic waste with biosorption, the key procedures and techniques are described briefly in the following section.

\section{Detection of REEs\authorA}

A relatively simple proof if a probe contains REEs is a precipitation reaction. It works by utilizing the +III and the +IV oxidization states of the REEs. These are used to form complexes with other molecules which express themselves as a coloured precipitation in the probe solution \footnote{Jander/Blasius: "Lehrbuch der analytischen und pr√§parativen anorganischen Chemie", Chapter 4.3.3.10}.

You must be careful though, as the detection of a specific REE is not always possible with these precipitation methods.

\section{Lanmodulin\authorA}

Lanmodulin (LanM) is a protein that is produced by \textit{M. extorquens}, a lanthanide-utilizing bacteria \cite{lanmdiscovery}. LanM is not essential for the growth or survival of \textit{M. extorquens} and it is only produced when the bacteria is in a medium with presence of \ce{Ln^{III}} or \ce{Ce^{III}} ions \cite{lanmroleinbiology}. However, the mechanisms that include LanM are not understood as a whole to this day. 

The most important characteristic of LanM is, that the molecule is able to bind lanthanide ions, primarily light REEs (LREEs). When LanM does this, it undergoes a transformation from a disordered state to a compact form of itself. The REEs are hereby bound to the so-called EF-hands which favour to bind to \ce{Ln^{III}} and other lanthanoids over \ce{Ca^{II}} which is usually associated with these EF-hands \cite{lanmstructure}.

In this visualisation the turquoise coloured spheres are \ce{Y^{III}} ions which are bound to the EF-hands.
