\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

We would like to express our gratitude for the smooth and conflict-free cooperation within our
project team.
Without it, our endeavor wouldn't have been possible.

Our supervisor, Benjamin
Seeburger M.Sc., deserves a special mention for helping us acquire all the necessary materials and
assisting us with research.

We are also thankful to Herbert Ofenmacher and Richard Sommerauer for
providing us with e-waste samples and neodymium magnets for our research.

Additionally, we would
like to thank Dipl. Ing. Andreas Scherfler and Dipl. Ing. Bernhard Schmeitzl who, despite being
supervisors of other teams, were eager to assist us with some of the problems that arose during our
project.

We would also like to extend our sincere thanks to the members of other project teams, who
were fun and engaging to be around. We would like to give a special shout-out to Robert, Jan, Emily,
Lilli, Magda, Samantha, Anna, and Mara.

We would be remiss in not mentioning the `L' key on Tobias'
keyboard, which fell victim to hours of vigorous typing for this thesis and got destroyed.
