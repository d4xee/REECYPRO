To further optimize this endeavor for industrial applicability, several imperative steps must be undertaken.
Primarily, there is a critical need to augment the efficiency of bacterial proliferation and the resultant yield of Rare Earth Elements (REEs).
Achieving this entails the development of innovative methodologies aimed at curtailing the growth duration and nutrient utilization by \emph{Methylorubrum extorquens}.
Moreover, the primary substrate for bacterial metabolism, methanol could be replaced with its more rudimentary and economically advantageous precursor, methane, which is also amenable to metabolization by \emph{M. extorquens}.
To realize the full-scale industrialization of this project, rigorous testing in expansive bioreactor systems is indispensable, alongside the incorporation of diverse forms of electronic waste.
Determining the most economically viable category of e-waste necessitates extensive experimental evaluation.
Concurrently, alongside the e-waste assessments, there arises a pressing need for the development of a high-capacity, efficient, and durable shredding apparatus tailored to handle various types of e-waste.
This undertaking poses multifaceted challenges, particularly in terms of safety and cost considerations.
An industrial-grade e-waste shredder must be inherently non-combustible and proficient in processing metal, plastic, fiberglass, and adhesive materials, all while maintaining optimal power consumption levels and facilitating facile maintenance protocols.
