    abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are a group of fifteen elements ranging from lanthanum (Z = 57) to lutetium (Z = 71), also called lanthanides. Two further elements, namely scandium (Z = 21) and yttrium (Z = 39), are often referred to as REEs because they have chemical properties similar to lanthanides and are commonly found in the same mineral assemblages. The modern applications of these elements are countless. They constitute critical components of many technological devices and new functional materials, as well as they are extensively used in medical diagnostic applications and for these reasons, REEs are raising new interests of scientists worldwide. The search for chemical sensors suitable for selective sensing of trivalent REE ions represents an important and hard challenge because of their complicated coordination properties due to not well-defined stereo-chemical requirements and an uncertain coordination number, especially in aqueous solution. This review focuses on some of the main works published in the area of fluorescent and electrochemical probes for the detection of REE ions.}

Recycling avoids the significant hurdles associated with opening new mines, but collection and disassembly of REE-containing devices are barriers. Absolute and relative abundances of REEs and co-occurring constituents differ significantly in secondary compared to primary sources, presenting challenges and opportunities. REE concentrations are typically low, but manufactured devices include only the desired REE, avoiding the ``REE balance problem'' that besets natural ores. Fewer REEs need to be separated, as compared to separation of the entire lanthanide series. Co-recovery of precious (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt) or base metals (e.g., Cu, Sn, Zn) from e-wastes can offset recycling costs. Some examples of recently developed approaches for REE extraction and separation are presented here, with an emphasis on methods offering environmental benefits such as lower toxic chemical usage and reduced energy costs.},

Despite these facts, typically only around 1% of the REE are recycled from end-products, with the rest deporting to waste and being removed from the materials cycle. This paper provides an overview of the current and future potential of the recycling of the REE, including outlining the significant but currently unrealised potential for increased amounts of REE recycling from end-uses such as permanent magnets, fluorescent lamps, batteries, and catalysts. This future potential will require a significant amount of research but increasing the amount of REE recycling will contribute to the overcoming some of the criticality issues with these elements. These include increased demand, issues over security of supply, and overcoming the balance problem where primary mine-derived sources overproduces lower demand REE without necessarily meeting demands for the higher demand REE.}

Since that discovery, the efforts of many investigators have revealed that lanthanide utilization is widespread in environmentally important bacteria, and parallel efforts have focused on elucidating the molecular details involved in selective recognition and utilization of these metals. In this review, we discuss the particular chemical challenges and advantages associated with biology's use of lanthanides, as well as the currently known lanthano-enzymes and -proteins (the lanthanome). We also review the emerging understanding of the coordination chemistry and biology of lanthanide acquisition, trafficking, and regulatory pathways. These studies have revealed significant parallels with pathways for utilization of other metals in biology. Finally, we discuss some of the many unresolved questions in this burgeoning field and their potentially far-reaching applications.}

              to utilize rare earth elements (REEs). To monitor the REE content
              in culture media of these bacteria, we have developed a rapid
              screening method using the Arsenazo III (AS III) dye for
              spectrophotometric REE detection in the low $\mu$M (0.1 to 10

              depletion from the culture medium by the acidophilic
              verrucomicrobial methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum
              strain SolV. The assay can also be modified to screen the uptake
              of other REEs, such as PrIII, or to monitor the depletion of
              LaIII from growth media in neutrophilic methylotrophs such as
              Methylobacterium extorquens strain AM1. The AS III assay presents
              a convenient and fast detection method for REE levels in culture

              spectroscopy (AAS).IMPORTANCE REE-dependent bacterial metabolism
              is a quickly emerging field, and while the importance of REEs for
              both methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria is now firmly
              established, many important questions, such as how these
              insoluble elements are taken up into cells, are still unanswered.
              Here, an Arsenazo III dye-based assay has been developed for
              fast, specific, and sensitive determination of REE content in
              different culture media. This assay presents a useful tool for
              optimizing cultivation protocols, as well as for routine REE
              monitoring during bacterial growth without the need for
              specialized analytical instrumentation. Furthermore, this assay
              has the potential to promote the discovery of other REE-dependent
              microorganisms and can help to elucidate the mechanisms for

In this paper, methods are described for detection of the colored impurities using DEAE-cellulose thinlayer chromatography in semiorganic solvents, along with methods for purification of the dye using DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and Chelex-100 ion-exchange resin. The impurities from one commercial lot are shown to exhibit significant absorbances over the range 400–725 nm; some of the impurities exhibit spectral shifts in the presence of Ca2+, implying Ca2+ binding. Thus, use of unpurified dye to quantitate ionized Ca2+ might yield data which vary with the source and batch of dye.

              metal yields without the use of harsh acids or high temperatures.
              The addition of organic acids increases REE leaching in a

               analyzing 189 Methylobacterium genomes from a wide range of
               habitats, including the phyllosphere, we inferred a robust
               phylogenetic tree while explicitly accounting for the impact of
               horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We showed that Methylobacterium
               contains four evolutionarily distinct groups of bacteria (namely
               A, B, C, D), characterized by different genome size, GC content,
               gene content, and genome architecture, revealing the dynamic
               nature of Methylobacterium genomes. In addition to recovering 59
               described species, we identified 45 candidate species, mostly
               phyllosphere-associated, stressing the significance of plants as
               a reservoir of Methylobacterium diversity. We inferred an
               ancient transition from a free-living lifestyle to association
               with plant roots in Methylobacteriaceae ancestor, followed by
               phyllosphere association of three of the major groups (A, B, D),
               whose early branching in Methylobacterium history has been
               heavily obscured by HGT. Together, our work lays the foundations
               for a thorough redefinition of Methylobacterium taxonomy,

              1976, was a monospecific genus created to accommodate a single
              pink pigmented facultatively methylotrophic bacterium. The genus
              now has over 50 validly published species, however, the

              one genus. Additionally, several strains are described as
              belonging to Methylobacterium, but nodulate legumes and in some
              cases are unable to utilize methanol as a sole carbon source.
              This study reviews and discusses the current taxonomic status of
              Methylobacterium. Based on 16S rRNA gene, multi-locus sequence
              analysis, genomic and phenotypic data, the 52 Methylobacterium
              species can no longer be retained in one genus. Consequently, a
              new genus, Methylorubrum gen. nov., is proposed to accommodate 11
              species previously held in Methylobacterium. The reclassified

               electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) system for the separation of proteins
               in the range from 1 to 100 kDa is described. Tricine, used as
               the trailing ion, allows a resolution of small proteins at lower
               acrylamide concentrations than in glycine-SDS-PAGE systems. A
               superior resolution of proteins, especially in the range between
               5 and 20 kDa, is achieved without the necessity to use urea.
               Proteins above 30 kDa are already destacked within the sample
               gel. Thus a smooth passage of these proteins from sample to
               separating gel is warranted and overloading effects are reduced.
               This is of special importance when large amounts of protein are
               to be loaded onto preparative gels. The omission of glycine and
               urea prevents disturbances which might occur in the course of
               subsequent amino acid sequencing.",
