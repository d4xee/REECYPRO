    abstract = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are a group of fifteen elements ranging from lanthanum (Z = 57) to lutetium (Z = 71), also called lanthanides. Two further elements, namely scandium (Z = 21) and yttrium (Z = 39), are often referred to as REEs because they have chemical properties similar to lanthanides and are commonly found in the same mineral assemblages. The modern applications of these elements are countless. They constitute critical components of many technological devices and new functional materials, as well as they are extensively used in medical diagnostic applications and for these reasons, REEs are raising new interests of scientists worldwide. The search for chemical sensors suitable for selective sensing of trivalent REE ions represents an important and hard challenge because of their complicated coordination properties due to not well-defined stereo-chemical requirements and an uncertain coordination number, especially in aqueous solution. This review focuses on some of the main works published in the area of fluorescent and electrochemical probes for the detection of REE ions.}

    abstract = {Rare-earth element (REE) demand is expected to increase by a factor of up to 7 by 2040. Recycling avoids the significant hurdles associated with opening new mines, but collection and disassembly of REE-containing devices are barriers. Absolute and relative abundances of REEs and co-occurring constituents differ significantly in secondary compared to primary sources, presenting challenges and opportunities. REE concentrations are typically low, but manufactured devices include only the desired REE, avoiding the ``REE balance problem'' that besets natural ores. Fewer REEs need to be separated, as compared to separation of the entire lanthanide series. Co-recovery of precious (e.g., Au, Ag, Pt) or base metals (e.g., Cu, Sn, Zn) from e-wastes can offset recycling costs. Some examples of recently developed approaches for REE extraction and separation are presented here, with an emphasis on methods offering environmental benefits such as lower toxic chemical usage and reduced energy costs.},

    abstract = {The rare earth elements (REE) are vital to modern technologies and society and are amongst the most critical of the critical elements. Despite these facts, typically only around 1% of the REE are recycled from end-products, with the rest deporting to waste and being removed from the materials cycle. This paper provides an overview of the current and future potential of the recycling of the REE, including outlining the significant but currently unrealised potential for increased amounts of REE recycling from end-uses such as permanent magnets, fluorescent lamps, batteries, and catalysts. This future potential will require a significant amount of research but increasing the amount of REE recycling will contribute to the overcoming some of the criticality issues with these elements. These include increased demand, issues over security of supply, and overcoming the balance problem where primary mine-derived sources overproduces lower demand REE without necessarily meeting demands for the higher demand REE.}

    abstract = {Lanthanides are relative newcomers to the field of cell biology of metals; their specific incorporation into enzymes was only demonstrated in 2011, with the isolation of a bacterial lanthanide- and pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent methanol dehydrogenase. Since that discovery, the efforts of many investigators have revealed that lanthanide utilization is widespread in environmentally important bacteria, and parallel efforts have focused on elucidating the molecular details involved in selective recognition and utilization of these metals. In this review, we discuss the particular chemical challenges and advantages associated with biology's use of lanthanides, as well as the currently known lanthano-enzymes and -proteins (the lanthanome). We also review the emerging understanding of the coordination chemistry and biology of lanthanide acquisition, trafficking, and regulatory pathways. These studies have revealed significant parallels with pathways for utilization of other metals in biology. Finally, we discuss some of the many unresolved questions in this burgeoning field and their potentially far-reaching applications.}

    abstract = "Recently, methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria were found
              to utilize rare earth elements (REEs). To monitor the REE content
              in culture media of these bacteria, we have developed a rapid
              screening method using the Arsenazo III (AS III) dye for
              spectrophotometric REE detection in the low $\mu$M (0.1 to 10
              $\mu$M) range. We designed this assay to follow LaIII and EuIII
              depletion from the culture medium by the acidophilic
              verrucomicrobial methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum
              strain SolV. The assay can also be modified to screen the uptake
              of other REEs, such as PrIII, or to monitor the depletion of
              LaIII from growth media in neutrophilic methylotrophs such as
              Methylobacterium extorquens strain AM1. The AS III assay presents
              a convenient and fast detection method for REE levels in culture
              media and is a sensitive alternative to inductively coupled
              plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or atomic absorption
              spectroscopy (AAS).IMPORTANCE REE-dependent bacterial metabolism
              is a quickly emerging field, and while the importance of REEs for
              both methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria is now firmly
              established, many important questions, such as how these
              insoluble elements are taken up into cells, are still unanswered.
              Here, an Arsenazo III dye-based assay has been developed for
              fast, specific, and sensitive determination of REE content in
              different culture media. This assay presents a useful tool for
              optimizing cultivation protocols, as well as for routine REE
              monitoring during bacterial growth without the need for
              specialized analytical instrumentation. Furthermore, this assay
              has the potential to promote the discovery of other REE-dependent
              microorganisms and can help to elucidate the mechanisms for
              acquisition of REEs by methanotrophic and methylotrophic
              bacteria.",
